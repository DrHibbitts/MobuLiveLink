# MotionBuilder Live Link

## NOTE: If you are trying to build the plugin from source and you are using a recent version of the Engine from Github you will need to go to \Engine\Source\Runtime\LiveLinkInterface\LiveLinkInterface.Build.cs and remove "TimeManagement" from the PublicDependencyModuleNames list.
## This has been fixed in the main branch as of 2018/09/26 

Enables Unreal to receives data from MotionBuilder via the Live Link system.

Currently built and tested with Unreal 4.18, 4.19, 4.20 and MotionBuilder 2016, 2017, 2018
